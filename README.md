# 2xT1xL
 A simple discord implementation of the common game Two Truths One Lie.
 In a single command, the bot shuffles your statements and prompts other users to select the lie via message reaction.
 
 Roadmap:
 - per-server configurable emoji sets
 - base, and per-server configurable, language filter
 - database implementation for user and game instance data
 - utilization of Modals framework (over slash commands) for user experience
